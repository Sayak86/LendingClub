## General Information
- We are working on a lending club case study data set to find out the key driver variables that can deter the impact of credit risk by tactfully identifying the reasons behind the charged off or the bad loans.
- We use the data set available in loan_cleaned.csv file. This file holds 5 years of loan details and borrower details. Each record in this data set can have one of the three loan status - Fully paid, Current and Charged Off.
- We have performed several univariate, bivariate and heat map analysis in support of our below conclusions.

## Conclusions
- The number of Fully Paid loans are significantly higher in number than the charged off loans.
- Debt consolidation is the highest number of loan types.
- Higher loan amounts are more vulnerable to be charged off.
- Conclusion 4 from the analysis.
- A lower annual income is contributing to higher number of charged off loans.
- Higher interest risk causes higher number of loans to be charged off.
- The better the loan grade the lower is the risk of charge off.
- Although Debt consolidation shares the highest number of loans, but smaall business loans are contributing most to the chanbred off loans.
- Ratio of charged off loans are highest in NY.
- Higher dti causes higher charged off loans.
